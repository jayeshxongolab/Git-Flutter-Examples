# Flutter-Examples

The goal of this project is to provide an ultimate collection of real world app's UIs. While I built Flutter UI for my own needs, it is also intented to showcase good app structure and a clean, well-organized Flutter codebase.

The source code is **100% Dart**, and everything resides in the [/lib] folder.

This project will try to **showcase most popular App Components and well-designed templates** that you will actually need and find useful.
